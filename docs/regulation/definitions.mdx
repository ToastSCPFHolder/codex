# Definitions

The definitions of the regulations of the Codex govern the interpretation and application.

## Violations

A violation is defined as any action or inaction that is contrary to the Codex. This includes violations that are intentional, unintentional, negligent, or work contrary to the spirit of the Codex.

### Tiers

Each regulation in the Codex is given a tier. The tier of a regulation determines the maximum sentence duration that can be imposed for a violation of that regulation. The tiers and their corresponding maximum sentence durations are as follows:
- **Tier-I**: 3 days.
- **Tier-II**: 1 week.
- **Tier-III**: 2 weeks.
- **Tier-IV**: 1 month.
- **Unacceptable**: Uncapped, with the potential for a Foundation or Communications Blacklist.

A regulation is able to specify minimum sentencing criteria if specific conditions of said violation are met. For example, a Tier-III regulation may specify that a minimum sentence of 1 week is required if the violation is committed with malicious intent.

If a minimum is not specified, the enforcing department may impose a sentence they deem fit with respect to both the context of the violation and its tier.

### Distinct

A violation must be distinct for a punishment to be imposed. A distinct violation is defined as an individual offense that is clearly separable from other violations, requiring the violator to have been able to avoid each violation under the specific circumstances, and not merely committed at the same time or in a similar manner as other offenses. It is important to note that the mere fact that multiple statutes or codes were violated does not constitute grounds for finding a distinct violation.

## Punishments

> **TODO:** Include link when the Foundation Blacklist Regulation Act is written.

The types of punishments that can be issued for a violation of the Codex are as follows: Formal Warning, Class-Expendable Sentence, Foundation Blacklist, and Communications Blacklist. The latter two are governed by the Foundation Blacklist Regulation Act and will not be described here.

### Formal Warning

Formal warnings are issued for minor violations of the Codex. If an individual has a formal warning on their record, this can be used by the enforcing department to justify a more severe punishment for future violations, especially if they are of a similar nature.

### Class-Expendable Sentence

A Class-Expendable sentence (or more commonly referred to as sentence) is an imposed sanction that restricts an individual's access to the Foundation. More specifically, you are suspended from all bodies in the Foundation and are not allowed to participate in certain activities on-site. This includes, but is not limited to: participating in events, usage of administrative commands, and joining departmental teams.
