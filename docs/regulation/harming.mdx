# Harming

Harming regulations are those that are concerned with physical harm on-site. This includes, but is not limited to: discharging of a weapon to damage an individual, using anomalous objects to cause harm, and going rogue.

## Self-Defense (Tier-II)

Self-defense is the authorized use of force to prevent harm to oneself in the face of an imminent threat.

Non-combative personnel may act in self-defense against hostiles if either:
- They have a weapon and are threatening to shoot/are shooting in the direction of and/or pointing a gun directly towards the personnel's body.
- They have killed you in your spawn 2 or more times and there is no way to exit your spawn and/or report them without being killed.

If there are 3 or more combatives in the area and/or a combative is capable of reacting to the threat, non-combatives are not allowed to act in self-defense.

Non-combative personnel are forbidden from acting in self-defense against other personnel.

## Rogue (Tier-III)

Rogue personnel are those who have willfully, negligently, or maliciously harmed other personnel. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Terminating other personnel with a weapon.
- Breaching anomalies.
- Interacting with the follow anomalies: 096's Image, 1162, or 409.
- Placing a bounty on another personnel.

The following steps are used to determine the minimum sentence duration for a rogue violation:
1. Start with a base sentence of a week (or 7 days).
2. Add 1 day for each violation beyond the first.
3. If the total reaches this tier's maximum sentence duration of 2 weeks (or 14 days), this number is capped at that point.
4. Multiply this total by the number of violations to get the final sentence length.

For example, if there are 10 violations, the minimum sentence duration would be 140 days.
