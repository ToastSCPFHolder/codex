# Leadership

The Foundation's leadership is comprised of the O5-Council and the Executives. Together, with their offices, they oversee the Foundation's operations and make decisions on matters of policy.

## O5-Council

The O5-Council (or the Council) is the highest governing body within the Foundation. It is composed of the Overseers of each department, as well as the O5-Executive. The Council is responsible for making decisions on matters of Foundation policy, as well as overseeing the operations of the various departments.

### Voting

The Council operates on a system of majority rule. Each member of the Council has one vote, and decisions are made based on the majority vote. In the event of a tie, the Executives have the deciding vote. The Executives may also veto any vote or decision made by the Council. All votes and decisions made by the Council have the force of law within the Foundation and must be followed by all personnel.

The results of the vote must be publicized to all personnel within the Foundation. The Executives may also choose to keep certain votes and decisions confidential, in which case only the Council members and the Executives will be privy to the information.

### Appointments and Removals

The Council is responsible for appointing and removing other Councilors. The Executives must approve all appointment and removal votes made by the Council. All Councilors are appointed for life, unless they choose to resign or are removed by the Council or the Executives.

### Hearings

The Council may hold hearings on matters of Foundation policy, personnel conduct, or other issues. The Council may also call witnesses to testify at these hearings. The Council may also choose to hold closed-door hearings, in which case only the Council members and the Executives will be present.

## Executives

The Administrator and O5-Executive (collectively referred to as the Executives) operate without constraints on their authority. Their directives take precedence over all policies and decisions within the Foundation.

Both Executives have the power to pardon any personnel from any punishment received by any body, appoint or remove individuals from any position, and create or dissolve official bodies within the Foundation.

### The Administrator

The Administrator is the highest-ranking authority within the Foundation, holding ultimate control over all aspects of its operations. They oversee the Foundation's funds and resources and have exclusive authority to appoint or dismiss the O5-Executive.

### O5-Executive

The O5-Executive (also known as the Executive) serves as the chairperson of the Council and is responsible for overseeing the Council and the Foundation's departments. The Executive has the power to make policy decisions and veto any Council votes or decisions, though their actions are subject to the Administrator's oversight.

## Offices

Each member of the Council and the Executives has an Office. The Office is comprised of a team of the member's choosing, primarily close advisors and current or former high-ranking members of the Department they are overseeing. The Office is entrusted with the Department itself, and has all the powers and responsibilities of the member they serve under, so long as the member authorizes it.

Each member of the Council is allowed to have one secretary, while the Executives are allowed to have two. Secretaries typically help with handling direct messages from personnel, but may also be tasked with other duties as needed.
