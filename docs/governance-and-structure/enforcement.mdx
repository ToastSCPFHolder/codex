# Enforcement

Enforcement departments have jurisdiction over certain aspects of regulatory enforcement for the purposes of their department. This system ensures that not one department has too much power over the others. This system is designed to allow certain departments to power check other, and to ensure that no department is able to act without oversight.

## Internal Intelligence Department
The Internal Intelligence Department (IID) is responsible for upholding security within the Foundation. Their primary concern is the defense of the Foundation from internal and external threats. They are responsible for:
1. the management of alternate accounts;
2. the prevention of cyber crimes;
3. the counteraction of espionage and corruption.

Because of the nature of what the IID does, all other information regarding the department is considered privileged.
