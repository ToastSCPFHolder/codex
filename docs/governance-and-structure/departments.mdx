# Departments

Departments are under the Foundation's umbrella that are designated for a specific task or function. All departments have the authority to create their own guidelines, recruitment process, and ranks, as long as they do not conflict with the Codex. This ability is called "departmental autonomy" or the ability to "self-govern." Departments grant clearance levels to their members depending on their rank.

## Clearance Levels

All Foundation personnel are assigned a clearance level based on their rank and responsibilities. The clearance levels range from Level-I to Level-V. The clearance level that is granted to a member is the highest one that can be afforded to them based on the highest rank that they hold.

### Level-I

Level-I serves as the first step in the Foundation hierarchy. Personnel at this level have demonstrated a basic understanding of Foundation operations and have been granted access to join other departments within the Foundation.

### Level-II

Level-II is granted to members who are low rank within a department. This allows them to serve as active members of their department and contribute to its operations.

### Level-III

Level-III is granted to members who are mid rank within a department. This allows them to take on more responsibilities and contribute to the department's operations in a more significant way.

### Level-IV

Level-IV is granted to members who are high rank within a department. This allows them to take on leadership roles and guide the department in fulfilling its responsibilities.

### Level-V

Level-V is granted to members who are the highest rank within a department. This allows them to oversee the department's operations and ensure that it fulfills its duties and responsibilities. They work closely with their Overseer to ensure that the department operates effectively. There can only be one Level-V member per department.

## Functional Structure of the Foundation

All bodies within Foundation, with a few exceptions, fall under one of these classifications: department, sub-department, division, and sub-division.

In special cases, a body may not best fit the classification it is given. While these are exceedingly rare, cases like these will be handled on a case-by-case basis by the O5-Council.

### Departments

A department has a specific set of responsibilities and is overseen by an Overseer. The maximum clearance level that can be granted by a department is Level-V. For a department to be created, it must be approved by the O5-Council.

Examples of departments are the Security Department, the Internal Security Department, and the Medical Department.

### Sub-Departments

For all intents and purposes, a sub-department is effectively the same as a department. The only difference is that a sub-department is overseen by the Overseer of another department. Sub-departments are sometimes also put under the jurisdiction of the Executives. Throughout the Codex, the term "department" will be used to refer to both departments and sub-departments. The department that it is under holds no authority over the sub-department.

Examples of sub-departments are the Moderation Team under the Administrative Department and the Department of Justice under the Executives.

### Divisions

A division (or unit) is under a department, responsible for a subset of the department's responsibilities. The department that it is under holds authority over the division. Divisional ranks can link up to departmental ranks but are not required to. An example of this is the Combat Medic's Commander in the Security Department is given the rank Colonel in the Department. For a division to be created, it must be approved by the Overseer of the department that it is under.

The maximum clearance level that can be granted by a division is Level-IV.

Examples of divisions are the Security Department's Combat Medic Division and the Task Forces under the Mobile Task Forces.

### Sub-Divisions

A sub-division (or sub-unit) is a further division of a division. They are the same as a division but they are under a division instead of a department. These are exceedingly rare as they require that a division needs to have a duty that needs to be further divided. It is important to note that people often use the word sub-division to refer to a division.

The maximum clearance level that can be granted by a sub-division is Level-III.

An example of sub-divisions are the Specialized Response Unit's Juggernauts.

## Department Classifications

Departments are classified based on their duties and functions. These classifications are as follows: civil, enforcement, and combative.

### Civil

Civil departments are responsible for operations that impact social and roleplay aspects of the Foundation. The civil departments are: the Scientific Department, Anomaly Actors, the Logistics & Engineering Department, the Medical Department, the Departmental of External Affairs, and the Administrative Department.

### Enforcement

Enforcement departments are responsible for the enforcement and upkeep of the Foundation's rules and regulations. The enforcement departments are: the Investigations & Enforcement Service, the Internal Security Department, the Moderation Team, and the Department of Justice.

### Combative

Combative departments are responsible for the defense and protection of the Foundation. The combative departments are: the Security Department and the Mobile Task Forces.
