# Voluntary Self-Blacklist

## Section I: Introduction

1. This Act lets individuals voluntarily blacklist themselves instead of resorting to acts of "self-sabotage." This way, individuals can proactively create boundaries that they decide on their own terms.
2. "Apply" within this Act—and all its forms, including "application," "applied," and "applying"—shall refer to the usage of the measures outlined herein.
3. "Applicant" shall refer to any individual seeking to use the measures provided by this Act.
4. "Blacklist" within this Act shall refer to a Foundation Blacklist.
5. "Term" within this Act shall refer to any conditions laid out in the agreement for the blacklist.
6. "Supervisor" within this Act shall refer to any authority designated by the Executives to be capable of supervising the appeal process.


## Section 2: Requirements & Conditions

1. The blacklist issued by any application must be at least 6 months long, and cannot be appealed during that time.
2. All other terms may be decided by the applicant, subject to reasonable scrutiny by the designated supervisor.
3. Should the blacklist be appealable after a certain period, it may be appealed immediately thereafter, should the terms be satisfied.
4. Once the blacklist is issued, all terms outlined therein are immutable, and cannot be modified by any party.

## Section 3: Procedures

1. The applicant must meet the following prerequisites before applying:
    1. They must not be coerced, blackmailed, or subject to external pressure that would otherwise compel them against their will;
    2. They must be of sound mind and act without any reservations.
2. The applicant must seek out a Councilor willing to confirm that the application is sound and meets all requirements.
3. To prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant meets the requirements under paragraph 1, the applicant must also find someone close to them who:
    1. Is willing to testify that the prerequisites have been met; and
    2. Can demonstrate to the Councilor, by relationship or other proof, that they share a genuine connection with the applicant, should it be inquired.
4. The applicant must demonstrate that their account is not compromised.
5. The applicant must explicitly and verbally agree to the provisions outlined in section 2.

## Section 4: Supervisory Duties

1. Unless otherwise specified by the Executives, it can be assumed that any Executive Secretary is a qualified supervisor.
2. The supervisor must create a group chat for the blacklist to take place and invite all relevant parties to it.
3. Once the procedures outlined in section 3 have been completed, all members of the aforementioned group chat must be removed.
4. A request for the blacklist to be issued must be submitted within 24 hours to any party capable of issuing blacklists, per the Foundation Blacklist Regulation Act.
5. The aforementioned party should be added to the group chat so that the proof can be documented.

## Section 5: Additional Provisions

1. Any modifications to this Act requires a unanimous vote by the Council, including any blacklists issued by its application.
2. The Councilor and the supervisor have full discretion over the application before the blacklist's issuance.
3. The Executives may grant exceptions within 72 hours of the blacklists' issuance if there is any reason to believe that the process was compromised in any way.
